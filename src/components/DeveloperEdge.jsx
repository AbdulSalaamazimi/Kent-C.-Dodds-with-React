                <p className="mb-20 text-lg text-gray-500 max-w-full">All of us are familiar with the feeling of stumbling around between YouTube videos, blog posts, and documentation just copy/pasting code and hoping it&apos;ll work. It&apos;s frustrating and unproductive. With these courses, you&apos;ll have the confidence you need to skip all that stumbling and start shipping. Coding is <strong> more fun</strong> this way, trust me ðŸ¥³</p>
                <h3 className="!text-lg !font-medium text-black mb-4">Earn more money as a developer</h3>
                <p className="mb-20 text-lg text-gray-500 max-w-full">The more skilled you are, the more you can get done and the more value you can provide to your employer and clients. If you don&apos;t think that comes with a bump in pay, ask the thousands of other devs who have experienced exactly this as a result of what they learned in these courses. Get that money ðŸ¤‘</p>
